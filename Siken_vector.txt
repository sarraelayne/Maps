You’re in a car with a beautiful boy and he won’t tell you that he loves you but he loves you And you feel like you’ve done something terrible like robbed a liquor store or swallowed pills or shoveled yourself a grave in the dirt and you’re tired You’re in a car with a beautiful boy and you’re trying not to tell him that you love him and you’re trying to choke down the feeling and you’re trembling but he reaches over and he touches you like a prayer for which no words exist and you feel your heart taking root in your body like you’ve discovered something you didn’t even have a name for Tell me how all this and love too will ruin us These our bodies possessed by light Tell me we'll never get used to it We have not touched the stars nor are we forgiven which brings us back to the hero’s shoulders and the gentleness that comes not from the absence of violence but despite the abundance of it Sorry about the blood in your mouth I wish it was mine I couldn't get the boy to kill me but I wore his jacket for the longest time A man takes his sadness down to the river and throws it in the river but then he’s still left with the river A man takes his sadness and throws it away but then he’s still left with his hands Everyone needs a place It shouldn't be inside of someone else You go to work the next day pretending nothing happened Your co-workers ask if everything's okay and you tell them you're just tired And you're trying to smile And they're trying to smile I sleep I dream I make up things that I would never say I say them very quietly Dear Forgiveness you know that recently we have had our difficulties and there are many things I want to ask you I tried that one time high school second lunch and then again years later in the chlorinated pool I am still talking to you about help I still do not have these luxuries I have told you where I’m coming from so put it together I want more applesauce I want more seats reserved for heroes Dear Forgiveness I saved a plate for you Quit milling around the yard and come inside Tell me we're dead and I'll love you even more You see I take the parts that I remember and stitch them back together to make a creature that will do what I say or love me back I swear I end up feeling empty like you've taken something out of me and I have to search my body for scars You wanted happiness I can’t blame you for that and maybe a mouth sounds idiotic when it blathers on about joy but tell me you love this tell me you’re not miserable Oh the things we invent when we are scared and want to be rescued Okay so I’m the dragon Big deal You still get to be the hero Fairy tales have rules You are a princess or you aren’t You are pure at heart or you aren’t If you are pure at heart or lucky you might catch a break
